### Database Schema

The existing JSONB structure accommodates all enhanced data:

```sql
-- Enhanced analysis structure
{
  "outsourcingLikelihood": "High|Medium|Low",
  "reasoning": "Enhanced reasoning with data references",
  "possibleServices": ["service1", "service2"],
  "confidence": 85,
  "keyInsights": ["insight1", "insight2"],
  "riskFactors": ["risk1", "risk2"],
  "opportunities": ["opportunity1", "opportunity2"],
  "recentActivity": {
    "newsCount": 5,
    "jobPostingsCount": 12,
    "hiringTrends": "Active hiring"
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Existing functionality remains the same
const result = await analyzeCompany('Apple Inc.');
```

### Enhanced Analysis (automatic)

```typescript
// Now includes enhanced data automatically
const result = await analyzeCompany('Microsoft');
// result.keyPeople contains executive information
// result.recentActivity shows hiring trends
// result.keyInsights provides deeper analysis
```

### Testing Enhanced Features

```bash
# Test endpoint for enhanced data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-enhanced \

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No enhanced data showing**

   - Check if API keys are configured
   - Verify environment variables are loaded
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Slow analysis times**

   - Normal for enhanced analysis (10-30 seconds)
   - Multiple API calls and AI processing
   - Consider upgrading API tiers for faster responses

3. **Email predictions not accurate**
   - Predictions based on common patterns
   - Accuracy varies by company email policies
   - Real emails provided when available from sources

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```env
DEBUG_ENHANCED_APIS=true
```

This will log all API calls, response times, and data processing steps.
