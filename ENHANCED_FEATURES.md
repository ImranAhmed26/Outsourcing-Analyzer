### Database Schema

The existing JSONB structure accommodates all enhanced data:

```sql
-- Enhanced analysis structure
{
  "outsourcingLikelihood": "High|Medium|Low",
  "reasoning": "Enhanced reasoning with data references",
  "possibleServices": ["service1", "service2"],
  "keyPeople": [
    {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "position": "Chief Technology Officer",
      "email": "john.doe@company.com",
      "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
      "department": "Technology"
    }
  ],
  "dataSourcesUsed": {
    "linkedin": true,
    "crunchbase": false,
    "website": true,
    "emailVerification": true
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis (unchanged)

```typescript
// Existing functionality remains the same
const result = await analyzeCompany('Apple Inc.');
```

### Enhanced Analysis (automatic)

```typescript
// Now includes enhanced data automatically
const result = await analyzeCompany('Microsoft');
// result.keyPeople contains executive information
// result.recentActivity shows hiring trends
// result.keyInsights provides deeper analysis
```

### Testing Enhanced Features

# Test endpoint for enhanced people data
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/test-people?company=Apple&website=apple.com"

# Test main analysis with enhanced data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"companyName": "Apple", "website": "apple.com"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No enhanced data showing**

   - Check if API keys are configured
   - Verify environment variables are loaded
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Slow analysis times**

   - Normal for enhanced analysis (10-30 seconds)
   - Multiple API calls and AI processing
   - Consider upgrading API tiers for faster responses

3. **Email predictions not accurate**
   - Predictions based on common patterns
   - Accuracy varies by company email policies
   - Real emails provided when available from sources

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```env
DEBUG_ENHANCED_APIS=true
```

This will log all API calls, response times, and data processing steps.
