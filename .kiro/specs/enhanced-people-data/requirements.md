# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced People Data Integration feature extends the existing outsourcing analyzer by providing real, verified contact information for key decision-makers at analyzed companies. This feature integrates multiple data sources to fetch accurate executive information, predict and verify email addresses, and enhance the outsourcing analysis with actionable contact data for business development purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business development professional, I want to see real key people and their verified email addresses for analyzed companies, so that I can directly contact decision-makers about outsourcing opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a company analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL fetch real executive data from LinkedIn API via RapidAPI
2. WHEN LinkedIn data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch data from Crunchbase API
3. WHEN API data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL scrape company website team pages for additional people information
4. WHEN people data is found THEN the system SHALL display up to 5 key executives with names, positions, and departments
5. WHEN no real data is available THEN the system SHALL fall back to realistic demo data to maintain UI consistency

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want accurate email addresses for key executives, so that I can reach out directly without spending time researching contact information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN people data lacks email addresses THEN the system SHALL predict emails using common corporate patterns
2. WHEN Hunter.io API key is available THEN the system SHALL verify predicted email addresses for deliverability
3. WHEN email verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL use the verified email address
4. WHEN email verification fails THEN the system SHALL use the most likely predicted pattern
5. WHEN generating email patterns THEN the system SHALL create firstname.lastname@domain.com, firstnamelastname@domain.com, and f.lastname@domain.com variations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the enhanced people data to integrate seamlessly with the existing analysis, so that I get comprehensive company information in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying analysis results THEN the system SHALL include a "Key People" section alongside existing company information
2. WHEN showing key people THEN the system SHALL display name, position, department, email, and LinkedIn profile link
3. WHEN LinkedIn profiles are available THEN the system SHALL provide clickable links to profiles
4. WHEN people data is from APIs THEN the system SHALL indicate "Verified" data source
5. WHEN people data is predicted THEN the system SHALL indicate "Predicted" data source

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced people data feature to be configurable and resilient, so that the application works reliably with or without external API access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are not configured THEN the system SHALL work with demo data without errors
2. WHEN external APIs fail THEN the system SHALL continue with available data sources
3. WHEN all data sources fail THEN the system SHALL use demo data as fallback
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN multiple data sources return results THEN the system SHALL deduplicate people based on name matching

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and test the enhanced people data functionality, so that I can ensure data quality and API integration health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the system THEN there SHALL be a test endpoint at /api/test-people for validation
2. WHEN accessing the test endpoint THEN the system SHALL show which data sources are configured
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL display sample results from each configured data source
4. WHEN APIs are misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
5. WHEN monitoring data quality THEN the system SHALL log successful API calls and fallback usage
